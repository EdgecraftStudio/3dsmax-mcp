    """Find meshes that pass through each other, touch, or float just short of contact.

    Scope: `names` checks those nodes pairwise. `names` + `against` checks each
    name only against the `against` nodes (e.g. all legs against the floor and
    seat). With neither, the current selection is used, or all visible geometry
    when nothing is selected. Only pairs whose world bounding boxes come within
    near_gap are measured.

    Status per pair, most severe first:
      penetrating  - a vertex lies inside the other closed mesh deeper than tolerance
      intersecting - surfaces cross with no vertex inside (thin parts, open meshes)
      touching     - closest vertex within tolerance of the other surface
      near_gap     - clearance above tolerance but within near_gap (floating parts)
      separate     - hidden unless include_separate=true

    depth is a lower bound (deepest inside vertex to surface); gap is an upper
    bound (vertex to surface). Both in scene units, world space, evaluated
    meshes with modifiers. tolerance defaults to 0.1 mm and near_gap to 10 mm,
    converted to scene units. Points are world positions to aim a camera or
    inspect_mesh at. An open mesh has no inside, so a part piercing it reports
    intersecting; its own vertices can still sit inside a closed part and report
    penetrating. Read only; the scene is not changed.
