    separate. Each row carries the submaterial and source path; procedural maps
    can have no file. The operation is read-only.

    Filename mismatches are advisory: inspect channel selection, conversions and
    renderer modes before changing anything. Mask inputs are identified separately.
    only_problems retains missing files, mismatches, warnings and incomplete reads.
    Follow next_offset for more results; pages are stable while the scene is unchanged.
    complete=false means there are unread pages, failed targets or a truncated graph.
    Increase depth/max_nodes for truncated graphs. Use inspect_material_network for
    parameter values. Requires a native bridge supporting graphVersion 2 connections.
